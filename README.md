# movies-list
omdb API powering React TypeScript app.
Created using vite - you will need an OMDB api key - 
npm run dev

This pulls data from the OMDB API and displays it is a React/Typescript app. The Api call asks for only movies with batman in the title )to limit the length of the returnd response), and allows the user to sort them in various ways.

This is a personal project to experiment with fetching and displaying data.
