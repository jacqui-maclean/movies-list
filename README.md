# movies-list

omdb API powering React TypeScript app.
Created using vite - you will need an OMDB api key -
npm run dev

This pulls data from the OMDB API and displays it is a React/Typescript app. The ap-i call searches only for movies containing batman in the title, and then allows the user to sort them in various ways.

This is a personal project to experiment with fetching and displaying data.
