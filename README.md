# movies-list

omdb API powering React TypeScript app.
Created using vite - you will need an OMDB api key -
npm run dev

This pulls data from the OMDB API and displays it is a React/Typescript app. The API call is for movies with batman in the title, and allows the user to sort them in various ways.

This is a personal project to experiment with fetching and displaying data.
